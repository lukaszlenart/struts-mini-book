# 1. Introduction

## About this book

This book is mostly addressed to people who are just starting using The Apache Struts in their project. Reading this book will allow you to grasp basic concepts laying behind the framework. At end of the book you will be able to use those concepts easily and with full understanding. I assume you have at least basic knowledge about Struts, you understand what Action mean, or Interceptor or Result. All these basic information can be obtained reading documentations or by reading [Starting Struts 2](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/starting-struts2) - a free book from InfoQ.

## What is Struts

The Apache Struts project is a web framework maintained under the Apache Struts Foundation. It's an open source project, run by volunteers. This is an action based framework which means that the framework doesn't maintain a state between requests, it just reacts to the performed action. Because of that it's fast and light without a few layers of processing request.

The main page of the project is here: [https://struts.apache.org](https://struts.apache.org), and you will find there all the information about past releases and the current documentation of the project.

## The areas of focus 

I focus on the few main areas in this books. The first is how to manage a project, how to use Maven to control dependency and build your project. If you don't know Maven don't be afraid, I will show you how to use it, how it can be a helpful tool. Then we go over basic configuration, to allow you to be more familiar with all the basic options you can use to adjust framework's behavior to your needs. Struts is a very flexible framework, you can use it on many different ways. We will also deep dive into Struts internals, to give you some overview how it works behind the scene. This an advance topic but don't worry, I will guide you smoothly over it. Next steps will introduce validation, how to use Spring connected with Struts and why should you use Tiles to compose your view layer. At the end of the book we will focus on security - both of your application and code your are writing, which means login & authentication and unit testing of your code.
